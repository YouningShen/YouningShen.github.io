      <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather, and related changes in oceans,
      </p>
      <p>
        land surfaces and ice sheets, occurring over time scales of decades or longer.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes in climate can occur through both natural and human-induced causes</h2>
      <p>
        Global climate varies naturally over time scales from decades to thousands of years and longer.
        These natural variations can originate in two ways: from internal fluctuations that exchange energy, water and carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land and ice, and from external influences on the climate system, including variations in the energy received from the sun and the effects of volcanic eruptions.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Human activities can also influence climate by changing concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering the concentrations of aerosols and altering the reflectivity of Earth’s surface by changing land cover.
      </p>

      <h2>The Causes of Climate Change</h2>
      <p>
        Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."
      </p>

      <h2>The Effects of Climate Change</h2>
      <p>
        Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.
